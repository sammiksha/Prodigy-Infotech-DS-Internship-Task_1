# Prodigy-Infotech-DS-Internship-Task_1
Task-01 focuses on visualizing population data using Python. Bar charts and stacked bar charts were created to analyze population distribution and gender-wise comparison for the year 2022.
In this task, I performed data visualization to analyze and represent population data using Python. The objective was to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable through bar charts, as specified in Task-01.

🔹 What was done:

Loaded and cleaned the population dataset using Pandas

Created a bar chart to visualize the Top 10 countries by total population (2022)

Built a stacked bar chart to compare male and female population distribution across countries

Ensured clear labeling, neat arrangement, and readable visualization

🔹 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

🔹 Key Learnings:

Understanding categorical vs numerical data

Selecting appropriate visualization techniques

Improving chart readability and presentation

Extracting meaningful insights from data

This task helped strengthen my foundational skills in data analysis and visualization, which are essential in data science workflows.
